## Things I learned while coding this website
### 1. Home Section
1.  CSS transitions does not work with underlines or more specifically -- with text-decoration
	* Refer [this](https://markrabey.com/2015/05/17/css-transition-for-text-decoration/)

2. Giving an element a particular opacity without making the text inside it get dimmer.
	* Refer [this](https://codepen.io/heisenberg_A_A/pen/RwKvWLm) -- use of pseudo elements
